# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - README

This project aims to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the services or products provided by a company. By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain their customers and reduce revenue loss.

## Project Overview

In this project, we build an ANN model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The ANN is a powerful machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. It consists of interconnected artificial neurons organized in layers, which allows it to learn complex patterns and make predictions.

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of customer features, such as demographics, usage behavior, and transaction history, along with the churn label indicating whether the customer has churned or not. The goal is to train an ANN model on this dataset to accurately classify customers as churned or not churned based on their features.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. It may also include any additional datasets or data preprocessing scripts.
- `models/`: This directory holds the trained ANN model and related files.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code files for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need to set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd customer_churn_prediction`.
3. Create a new Python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`.
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`.
5. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the customer churn prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Place your dataset file (e.g., `customer_data.csv`) inside the `data/` directory.
2. Preprocess the data:
   - Modify the preprocessing code in `src/preprocess.py` to suit your dataset.
   - Run the preprocessing script: `python src/preprocess.py`.
3. Train the ANN model:
   - Adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters in `src/train_model.py` if necessary.
   - Run the training script: `python src/train_model.py`.
4. Evaluate the model:
   - Modify the evaluation code in `src/evaluate_model.py` to match your dataset.
   - Run the evaluation script: `python src/evaluate_model.py`.
5. Interpret the results and make predictions using the trained model.

Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different approaches to improve the churn prediction performance.

## Conclusion

Predicting customer churn is essential for businesses to retain customers and maximize revenue. This project demonstrates how to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on historical data. By following the instructions provided in this README, you can apply the code to your own dataset and leverage the power of ANN for customer churn prediction.
